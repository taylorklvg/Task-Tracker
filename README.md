# Task-Tracker
 
### About
A lightweight productivity app I originally built for myself, then developed into a polished desktop app. It lets you quickly add, complete, and manage tasks with features like recurring scheduling, due-date alerts, heads-up reminders, and dark mode.

### Features
- Light/dark mode toggle
- One time and recurring tasks, handles edge cases like early completion or overdue tasks by recalculating the next due date dynamically
- Desktop notifications
- Search, filter, and sort
